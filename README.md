# My Application

The project is generated by [LoopBack 2.x](http://loopback.io).


##This repository

### The purpose

Our goal in this project is just to provide some training code and a tutorial to cretate a tiny serveur with loopback.

### The Example

We will try to build a server for manganing shops of cars.
The server should be able to: 
* Create a shop with starting cash
* A shop can buy buy and sell cars
* Get the cash available in the store


### Generate the serveur

This command will generate the server:

```bash
lb
```
By default, if you choose to build an API, you will get a built-in model: User

### Add Model

We need two models Car and Shop.
Let's generate them:

```bash
lb model
```

### Add relations between models

Let's have a look to our [LoopBack](http://loopback.io/doc/en/lb2/Tutorial-model-relations.html). 

In our case we want a shop to have several cars.
So we will use a **HasMany** relation.

```bash
lb relation
```
