# My Application

The project is generated by [LoopBack 2.x](http://loopback.io).


##This repository

### The purpose

Our goal in this project is just to provide some training code and a tutorial to cretate a tiny serveur with loopback.

### The Example

We will try to build a server for manganing shops of cars.
The server should be able to: 
* Create a shop with starting cash
* A shop can buy and sell cars
* Get the cash available in the store


### Generate the serveur

This command will generate the server:

```bash
lb
```
By default, if you choose to build an API, you will get a built-in model: User

### Add Model

We need two models Car and Shop.
Let's generate them:

```bash
lb model
```

### Add relations between models

Let's have a look to our [LoopBack](http://loopback.io/doc/en/lb2/Tutorial-model-relations.html). 

In our case we want a shop to have several cars.
So we will use a **HasMany** relation.

```bash
lb relation
```

### Add remote method

#### cashAvailable

The first and easiest method we have to implement is cashAvailable.
It is aimed to give the current cash available.

|Type|Input|Output|
|---|---|---|
| GET | id | cashAvailable |

#####Define the function on the API

In the shop.js file, add

```javascript
Shop.remoteMethod(
        'cashAvailable', {
            http: {
                path: '/cashAvailable',
                verb: 'get'
            },
            accepts: {
                arg: 'id',
                type: 'string',
                http: {
                    source: 'query'
                }
            },
            returns: {
                arg: 'cashAvailable',
                type: 'number'
            }
        }
    );
```
#####Define the function itself

In the shop.js file define:

```javascript
    Shop.cashAvailable = function(shopId, cb) {
        Shop.findById(shopId, function(err, instance) {
            console.log('instance', instance);
            var cashAvailable = instance.cash;
            cb(null, cashAvailable);
        });
    };
```
